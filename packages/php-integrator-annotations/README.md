This package provides annotations for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

What is included?
  * Annotations for class methods that are implementing a method from an interface.
  * Annotations for class methods and properties that are overriding base class or trait members.
  * Tooltips on mouse over that clarify why the annotations are cluttering your gutter with additional icons.
  * Annotations for overrides and implementations can be clicked to navigate to respectively the method being overridden or implemented.
