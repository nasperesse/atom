## Legacy
Autocompletion is included in the [base package](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base) since version 3.2.0. This package has become redundant as a result. It will likely cease to stop working in the future as new versions of the base package are released.

## About
This package provides autocompletion for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base) as well as Atom's [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

What is included?
  * Autocompletion for local variable names.
  * Autocompletion for global functions and constants.
  * Autocompletion (snippets) for tag names in docblocks.
  * Autocompletion for class, interface and trait members.
  * Autocompletion for class, interface and trait names as well as their constructors.
  * Automatic adding of use statements when class names are autocompleted (with a somewhat intelligent positioning).
    * Included is a command to sort the current use statements.
