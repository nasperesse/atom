  abstract={In this article, we extend our previous results for the orthogonal group SO(2,4) to its homomorphic group SU(2,2). Here we present a
    closed finite formula for the exponential of a 4*4 traceless matrix, which can be viewed as the generator (Lie algebra elements) of the SL(4,C)
    group. We apply this result to the SU(2,2) group, the lie algebra of which can be represented by Dirac matrices, and discuss how the exponential map
    for SU(2,2) can be written by means of Dirac matrices.}
